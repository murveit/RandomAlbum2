## Random Album
This is an Android app to play full albums (ordered randomly) from music stored on your Android phone.
I originally wrote this app sometime around 2010 or so (can't remember exactly), but recently re-wrote it by instructing Gemini for a day. It didn't do a bad job, and has very similar functionality.
